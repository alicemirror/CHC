## Circuit Health Controller
From a server to a SBC (Single Board Computer) or the board of your last project I see that it is not rare nor strange the need to keep the entire architecture under control to avoid excessive shocking vibrations, too much heating, adding a reliable digital power on/off system or reset the entire device under certain conditions as well as the availability of constantly updated parameters like the internal device temperature, the buttons pressed by the user (or state of some external digital input), the number of hours the system is running (e.g. to test the battery durability).

The ***Circuit health control Arduino compatible*** is based on a first project specifically developed to control a SBC server. Making making this board *general purpose*, *easy customisable* and *compatible with the popular Arduino boards* this repository include the actually included firmware. The board is delivered with this software (the last available update) onboard installed on an AVR328p. 

The sources of the repository are released unthe a **CC license 3.0 NC-ND-SA** that users can adopt as-is or customize by their own.

Further information, board features and schematics details are available on Element14 Arduino Blog.

This board is available with several cnfigurable options on the Drobott.com online robotics portal at the following address:
